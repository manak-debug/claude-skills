> **Alpha**: These skills are in active development and subject to rapid change.

Agent skills for [Kapso](https://kapso.ai), built on the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) format.

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add gokapso/agent-skills
```

## Environment Variables

Set these environment variables before using the skills:

```bash
export KAPSO_API_BASE_URL="https://api.kapso.ai"
export KAPSO_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `KAPSO_API_BASE_URL` | Kapso API host. Use `https://api.kapso.ai` |
| `KAPSO_API_KEY` | API key from the Kapso web app at [app.kapso.ai](https://app.kapso.ai) |

## Path selection

- Prefer the Kapso CLI when it is installed and already authenticated. The skill docs show CLI-first flows where the CLI already covers the task well.
- Keep the provided scripts and direct API references as the fallback path when the CLI is unavailable or when a task still needs script-only operations.
- If you use the CLI path, start with `kapso login` and `kapso status`.

## What are Agent Skills?

Agent Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can discover and use to perform tasks more accurately. Each skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` entrypoint and optional supporting files.

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md          # Required: instructions + metadata
├── scripts/          # Optional: executable code
├── references/       # Optional: documentation
└── assets/           # Optional: templates, resources
```

Skills use **progressive disclosure**: agents load only the name and description at startup, then read full instructions when a task matches. This keeps context usage efficient while giving agents access to detailed knowledge on demand.

## Available skills

- **integrate-whatsapp**: Connect WhatsApp, set up webhooks, send messages/templates, manage flows
- **automate-whatsapp**: Build WhatsApp automations with workflows, agents, functions, and databases
- **observe-whatsapp**: Search Logs, debug delivery issues, inspect webhook deliveries, triage errors, run health checks

Each skill contains detailed documentation in its `SKILL.md` file.

## Maintenance

Shared references in this repo also exist under `kapso-docs/skills/skills`. Keep mirrored docs in sync when updating shared onboarding or API guidance.

## SKILL.md format

Each skill requires a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does and when to use it.
---

# My Skill

Instructions for the agent...
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Lowercase identifier (letters, numbers, hyphens) |
| `description` | Yes | When to use this skill (max 1024 chars) |
