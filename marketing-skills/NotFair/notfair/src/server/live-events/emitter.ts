 * live turn receive the event in milliseconds instead of waiting for the
 * next 500ms DB poll.
 *
 * Single-process only (NotFair is a local Next.js app). If we ever
 * cluster, swap this for a Redis pub/sub or move events through the DB
 * with NOTIFY/LISTEN — same subscriber API at the call site.
