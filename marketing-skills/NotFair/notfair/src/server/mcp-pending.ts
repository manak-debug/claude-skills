 * In-process map of pending MCP OAuth flows. Keyed by `state` (the CSRF
 * token in the authorize URL). Lives in the Next.js server process and is
 * lost on restart — that's fine because the flow is short-lived: from
 * "click Connect" to "back at callback" is seconds, not days.
 *
 * Keeping this in-memory (vs. SQLite) avoids a migration + cleanup job for
 * what is otherwise transient data. Two entries with the same `state` is
 * cryptographically improbable; we still use `consume` (pop, not peek) so
 * a replayed callback can't reuse the same exchange context.
