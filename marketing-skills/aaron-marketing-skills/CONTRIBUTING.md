Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide covers adding skills, improving existing ones, and submitting changes.

## Requesting a Skill

[Open a Skill Request issue](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills/issues/new?template=skill-request.yml) if you have an idea but don't want to build it yourself.

## Adding a New Skill

### 1. Choose the correct category

| Category | Directory | Use when the skill... |
|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| Narrative | `narrative/<phase>/` | Traces, architects, lands, and proves brand narrative & messaging (TALE loop: trace/architect/land/evaluate) |
| SEO/GEO | `seo-geo/<phase>/` | Surveys demand, implements content/markup, tunes quality/tech, evaluates authority & rankings (SITE loop: survey/implement/tune/evaluate) |
| Social | `social/<phase>/` | Plans, crafts, hosts, and measures organic social (ECHO loop: explore/craft/host/observe) |
| Email | `email/<phase>/` | Grows, sends, and audits email programs (SEND loop: setup/engage/nurture/deliver) |
| Paid Ads | `ad/<phase>/` | Builds, audits, and scales paid-ad campaigns (ROAS loop: research/orchestrate/activate/scale) |
| Influencer | `influencer/<phase>/` | Scouts audiences/creators, targets campaigns, activates outreach & the STAR gate, reports ROI (STAR loop: scout/target/activate/report) |
| Launch | `launch/<phase>/` | Plans, gates, executes, and proves product launches (RAMP loop: research/assemble/mobilize/prove) |
| Protocol | `protocol/` | Cross-cutting layer (7 truth registries: entity/creator/claims/consent/launch/channel/narrative + memory) — shared across disciplines |

### 2. Create the skill directory

```bash
mkdir -p <category>/<skill-name>
```

Directory name: 1-64 chars, lowercase `a-z`, numbers, hyphens only. No leading/trailing/consecutive hyphens.

### 3. Create `SKILL.md` with required frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: your-skill-name
slug: aaron-your-skill-name
displayName: "Your Skill Name · 中文名"
summary: "一句话中文简介(SkillHub.cn 列表卡片)"
version: "1.0.0"
description: 'Use when the user asks to "[trigger]". [What it does]. For [related task], see [other-skill].'
license: Apache-2.0
compatibility: "Claude Code and compatible agent-skill hosts"
homepage: "https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills"
when_to_use: "[One line on when this skill applies — underscores in the key, not hyphens]"
argument-hint: "<main-input> [--optional-flag]"
metadata: {"author": "your-github-username", "version": "1.0.0", "discipline": "seo-geo", "phase": "survey", "geo-relevance": "high|medium|low", "hermes": {"tags": ["marketing", "seo-geo", "survey"], "category": "seo-geo"}, "openclaw": {"emoji": "🔍", "homepage": "https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills"}}
---
```

All eleven keys above (plus top-level `homepage`) appear on every shipped skill. The only sanctioned *extra* top-level keys are `class: auditor` (the 8 gate skills only) and `allowed-tools` (skills that fetch URLs, e.g. `WebFetch`). The `metadata` key set is fixed: `author` / `version` / `discipline` / `phase` / `geo-relevance` / `hermes` / `openclaw` — no other keys.

The `name` field must match the directory name exactly. `metadata` must be a **single-line strict-JSON object** (valid YAML flow mapping) — OpenClaw's frontmatter parser reads single-line keys only, and the validator fails a YAML block map. In single-quoted scalars, double any literal apostrophe (`designer''s`). Keep the `hermes` (tags/category) and `openclaw` (emoji/homepage) host extensions in step with the skill's discipline. The `slug`/`displayName`/`summary` trio is the [SkillHub.cn](https://skillhub.cn) publishing contract — `slug` must be the platform-owned frontmatter slug (`<skill-name>` when available, otherwise `aaron-<skill-name>` as the conflict fallback; validator-enforced), `displayName` bilingual, `summary` a Chinese one-liner.

### 4. Write effective instructions

Use the compact shared skeleton from `references/skill-contract.md`: `Quick Start`, `Skill Contract`, `Handoff Summary`, `Data Sources`, `Instructions`, `Reference Materials`, and `Next Best Skill`. Optional sections such as `What This Skill Does`, `Example`, `Tips for Success`, `Save Results`, and `Validation Checkpoints` are welcome when they improve execution quality. Put detailed references in the skill's `references/` subdirectory.

Declare activation-critical local files only in an exact closed `### Runtime Reads` section, with one repository-local Markdown or JSON path per bullet. Ordinary Markdown links remain optional navigation and must never become required runtime context merely because nearby prose says “read.” After changing a skill or a bound reference, regenerate both machine contracts and model capsules with `python3 scripts/generate-skill-contracts.py --write` and `python3 scripts/generate-skill-capsules.py --write`. The generated `references/skill-capsules/` tree is a compact model-facing projection, not an authoring surface; never hand-edit it. Likewise, regenerate the compact root discovery table with `python3 scripts/generate-claude-index.py --write` after adding, moving, renaming, or removing a skill.

Auditor-class skills are the exception: repository mode reads the root typed runtime; each auditor also ships a generated immutable `references/auditor-runtime.md` for standalone installs. Keep only framework-specific examples, guardrails, and veto translations inline. Eight skills are auditor-class gate consumers, each scored against one framework and writing to its own audit sink:

| Auditor-class skill | Framework | Audit sink |
|---------------------|-----------|------------|
| `content-quality-auditor` | CORE-EEAT (publish readiness) | `memory/audits/content/` |
| `domain-authority-auditor` | CITE (citation trust) | `memory/audits/domain/` |
| `creator-content-auditor` | STAR SQS (influencer content gate) | `memory/audits/influencer/` |
| `ad-account-auditor` | ROAS RQS (paid-ads gate) | `memory/audits/ad/` |
| `email-quality-auditor` | SEND EQS (email SEND gate) | `memory/audits/email/` |
| `launch-readiness-auditor` | RAMP lifecycle-profile gate | `memory/audits/launch/` |
| `social-quality-auditor` | ECHO asset/program-profile gate | `memory/audits/social/` |
| `narrative-quality-auditor` | TALE truth/system/effectiveness gate | `memory/audits/narrative/` |

Cross-cutting reference protocols apply across disciplines: the humanizer-slop protocol, the measurement-protocol decision protocol, and the per-channel `platforms/` reference packs. These stay references (not skills) by design — each is consumed as a pre-handoff sub-step inside discipline skills, so promoting one to a standalone skill would duplicate that step.

### 5. Validate

```bash
./scripts/validate-skill.sh <category>/<skill-name>
```

CI runs additional guards beyond the per-skill validator:
- **golden behavior** — runs every typed profile through the real catalog/scorer, including Unknown, one-veto, multi-veto, cap, and STAR rollup boundaries; it never regex-scrapes Markdown formulas.
- **behavior conformance** — orchestrates rubric, registry, HTTP, hook, permission, and routing suites offline; strict smoke/change-aware/nightly profiles select 24 to 700 provenance-bound semantic cases. Protocol v2 is the current real-provider smoke and engineering-maturity evidence path; protocol v3 adds blind route → selected context → independent judge execution for paired explicit-versus-balanced/lean evaluation. Model-backed adapters remain outside credential-free CI.
- **runtime protocol** — verifies operational run idempotency, event trees/hash chains, immutable snapshots/save points/envelopes, concurrency, bounded resume, Git-ignore/path defenses, and the non-authority boundary.
- **audit outer loop** — verifies event-first v2 anchors and same-request step recovery, verification-only public binding, selected-ancestry/sibling-isolated closure, a reserved terminal event slot, strict success versus bounded failed/aborted escape, exact active-loop coverage for waiting/needs-input/blocked, lease fencing, monotonic time, optimistic concurrency, separate retry/cycle/byte/deadline budgets, audit identity and observation-time provenance, strict convergence, exact-byte deduplication, graph-wide exact-hash linkage, and control-escaped terminal output without executing interventions.
- **architecture conformance** — checks `references/system-catalog.json` against all 120 paths/frontmatters, plugin order, framework/auditor/registry ownership, transition graphs, L1 dependencies, distribution contracts, and the **symmetry contract** (SYM-01..17: loop/acronym derivation, command selector, registry/gate naming and topology, score surfaces, grouping titles, Scope edges, metadata key set — every violation must be licensed by a `symmetry.deviations` entry, and stale deviations fail).
- **five-engineering maturity** — validates the closed 100-control Prompt/Context/Harness/Loop/Graph rubric and report contract. Before release, run `python3 scripts/check-engineering-maturity.py --semantic-evidence-run-id <uuid>` against a complete current-source protocol-v2 real-provider smoke run; every dimension must reach 95/100 and pass its hard gates. Protocol-v3 compact certification is separate: it requires canonical real cases, stored hash-chained v3 provenance for every arm, an immutable model revision, and a current Governed binding. The current 700-case corpus is simulated and the bundled adapter reports a null revision, so no compact binding is certified and `explicit` remains the deployment default. Until a release carries either complete paired evidence for trusted revalidation or a signed release attestation, distribution builds and manifest verification reject every non-empty `certified_bindings` array; package-local hashes alone are never promotion authority.

Build the four physical archives users receive and run their boundary tests.
The Lite, Pro, and Governed plugin archives share the 120 canonical Skills and
eight commands; a fresh project resolves to Lite in all three and the archive
controls only the maximum available capability. The fourth archive is the
static Agent Plugins v1 Portable Lite projection: 120/120 strict Skills with no
commands, hooks, connectors, executable repository runtime, or `mcp.json`.

```bash
python3 scripts/build-release-assets.py \
  --source-repo /path/to/aaron-marketing-skills \
  --source-repository aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills \
  --source-commit <exact-40-hex-release-commit> \
  --version 20.0.0 \
  --output /private/path/v20.0.0-release-assets
python3 -m unittest tests.test_distribution_builder tests.test_release_assets tests.test_publish_release tests.test_publish_state
```

Build and validate the Portable Lite projection directly when changing Skills,
their reachable static references, or the projection contract:

```bash
python3 scripts/build-distribution.py \
  --agent-plugin --profile portable-lite \
  --output /private/path/aaron-agent-plugin
python3 scripts/validate-agent-plugin.py \
  /private/path/aaron-agent-plugin
python3 scripts/build-distribution.py \
  --verify-manifest /private/path/aaron-agent-plugin \
  --profile portable-lite
```

Add `--source-repository owner/repo` and `--source-commit
<40-or-64-hex-object-id>` to the manifest-verification command when exact
provenance must match. The repository root is the authoring SSOT, not an Agent
Plugins v1 install root. Generate into an untracked directory outside the repo;
never add or commit a root `skills/` mirror. See
[`docs/agent-plugins-v1.md`](docs/agent-plugins-v1.md).

The allowlist in `references/distribution-files.json` is authoritative. Runtime additions must be declared there; tests, evals, CI, generators, and repository-maintenance documentation must not leak into the plugin payload. The builder rejects symlinks, special files, and multiply linked files and emits a complete SHA-256 manifest with its physical profile ceiling. Governed distributions carry the generated capsule index as a reference-only model projection; generic shared-root host projections additionally replace slash commands with eight router facades. Host catalogs and sidecars bind every facade and target to exact hashes, while standalone installs continue to route directly to one complete skill. To meet the Governed hard budget, the builder deterministically replaces the expanded `references/skill-contracts/` tree with `references/skill-contracts.pack.json.gz`; the resolver accepts that derived pack only after bounded decompression and exact record/aggregate hash checks. Keep expanded generated trees in source control for review and CI, and never hand-edit a pack, capsule, facade, compact root index, or portable projection. Bare `--plugin` is a deprecated Governed-ceiling alias through v20; contributor and release commands must name `--profile`. The release-asset builder privately exports one exact Git commit, builds Lite/Pro/Governed plus Agent Plugins v1 Portable Lite independently, emits four canonical fixed-root tarballs plus `SHA256SUMS` and `release-assets.json`, safely unpacks them, and verifies each profile/projection/provenance-bound manifest against a fresh build of that same commit. Run it twice into new directories and require all six outputs to be byte-identical before release. Every live release publisher/projector accepts only a clean commit reachable from successfully refreshed `origin/main`; per-skill and built-package publishers package a private Git export of that pinned commit and verify repository/commit-bound manifests before upload. Dry-runs do not apply the live clean-tree gate. Standalone one-folder auditor bundles stay compact and fail closed; regenerate them with `python3 scripts/generate-auditor-runtime.py --write` after changing any bound source. Auto-routing cases are maintained only in `evals/auto-routing-scenarios.source.md`; regenerate the runtime index/eight shards with `python3 scripts/generate-auto-routing-shards.py --write` and never hand-edit the generated views. Auditor prompt contracts are maintenance/evaluation artifacts derived from the system/framework catalogs and bound sources; regenerate them with `python3 scripts/generate-auditor-prompt-contracts.py --write` and never hand-edit `references/prompt-contracts/`.
- **check-evals** — strict case parsing plus structural lint over all 700 authored/generated semantic fixtures and their real-evidence bindings (phase directories and command selectors derive from the system catalog).
- **check-context-budget** — the progressive-disclosure budget as a hard gate: compact root-policy and combined-agent byte ceilings, SKILL.md line caps, capsule-plus-kernel and auditor activation-chain byte budgets, recursive per-reference byte budgets, the largest valid command + index + three-shard `/auto` assembly, and the HOT template's runtime 80-line/25 KB limit.
- **check-routing** — description-routing health as a hard gate: quoted trigger phrases are uniquely owned across all 120 skills, every description carries a `Not for X — use Y` boundary clause, and bare-name handoffs in Next Best Skill blocks resolve to real skills.
- **check-local-links** — every repo-local Markdown link target must resolve inside the repo.
- **check-pii** — scans for committed PII. Enable the repository pre-commit hook once
  per clone with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`; CI independently scans every
  tracked index blob with `python3 scripts/check-pii.py --tracked`.
- **check-stdlib-only** — enforces the zero-dependency Python-stdlib rule for connector helpers, including the Paid-Ads keyed-API red line (no keyed paid-ad API calls baked into skills).

### 6. Update tracking files

After adding or updating a skill, keep these **10 tracking surfaces** in sync. **This list is authoritative** — `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` point here instead of restating it, so update this list if the set changes.

- `references/system-catalog.json` — canonical layer/order/phase/path/auditor/registry/distribution topology and release version; regenerate `docs/system-architecture.md`
- `VERSIONS.md` — version and date
- `references/publication-metadata.json` — editable public identity, marketplace, About, skills.sh grouping, locale, and marker-template metadata
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — generated skills array + version
- `marketplace.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — generated byte-identical marketplace projections
- `openclaw.plugin.json` — generated OpenClaw identity/version projection
- `README.md` — authored content plus generated version/current-bundle marker regions
- `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `SECURITY.md` — authored policy plus generated current-release marker regions
- `docs/README.{zh,de,es,fr,it,ja,ko,pt,zh-Hant}.md` — authored localized content plus generated version/current-bundle marker regions
- `.github/repo-about.json` and `skills.sh.json` — generated About and grouped-discovery projections; project About to GitHub with `bash scripts/sync-about.sh --live`

Do not hand-edit a generated JSON projection or marker body. After changing the
catalog/publication sources, run
`python3 scripts/generate-release-surfaces.py --write`, then `--check`. For a
coordinated release, use the dry-run-by-default
`python3 scripts/bump-release.py --to X.Y.Z --date YYYY-MM-DD --align-all-skills`
transaction before its `--write` form; this updates only current product
bindings and leaves historical/schema/protocol versions intact.

**Adding or renaming a skill?** Also add its slug to a grouping in the repo-root `skills.sh.json` — the [skills.sh registry page](https://skills.sh/aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills) renders those sections, and CI fails when the groupings don't cover exactly the plugin.json skill set (an ungrouped skill would render below the legacy names at the bottom of the page).

**Cutting a release?** v19 is released on an exact-source
**engineering-validation** gate. Freeze the RC commit; pass repository CI,
the complete current-source real-provider smoke run, the five-dimension
engineering-maturity check, and two byte-identical profile-asset builds; then
issue a private `engineering-validation-v19` receipt with
`scripts/issue-engineering-release-receipt.py`:

```bash
python3 scripts/issue-engineering-release-receipt.py \
  --semantic-evidence-run-id "<fresh-current-source-run-uuid>" \
  --evidence-root "/private/project-root" \
  --release-candidate "20.0.0-rc.N" \
  --owner-authorization "release-v19-without-real-project-outcomes" \
  --maturity-report-output "/private/path/v19-engineering-maturity-report.json" \
  --output "/private/path/v19-engineering-release-receipt.json"
```

The issuer directly runs the maturity
audit and, in the same invocation, creates the exact private report and its
hash-bound receipt outside Git with exclusive mode-0600 files. Treat the
receipt, report, and raw semantic-evidence root as one private verification
bundle:

```bash
export AARON_RELEASE_RECEIPT="/private/path/v19-engineering-release-receipt.json"
export AARON_RELEASE_MATURITY_REPORT="/private/path/v19-engineering-maturity-report.json"
export AARON_RELEASE_EVIDENCE_ROOT="/absolute/private/project-root"
python3 scripts/verify-release-receipt.py "$AARON_RELEASE_RECEIPT" \
  --source-commit "$(git rev-parse --verify 'HEAD^{commit}')" \
  --release-version 20.0.0 \
  --required-gate engineering-validation-v19 \
  --maturity-report "$AARON_RELEASE_MATURITY_REPORT" \
  --evidence-root "$AARON_RELEASE_EVIDENCE_ROOT"
```

Every v19 live publisher requires all three variables and rapidly revalidates
the receipt, the exact report bytes, and the original semantic event chain with
the current verifier. Receipt issuance and `create-github-release.py --live`
always enforce the strict 24-hour freshness gate for the receipt and semantic
evidence.
After the immutable final tag, non-draft Release, exact six assets, and owner
workflow have all been verified, publisher entrypoints may internally use the
explicit post-release-continuation verifier mode: it relaxes only the current
wall-clock check, still proves issuance-time freshness and every
receipt/report/raw-evidence/tool/source hash, and remains bounded by the
committed semantic policy (currently 30 days). Do not invoke that mode to create
or authorize a release. If the policy window expires, run fresh provider
evidence against the same immutable release commit and issue a new private
report/receipt before resuming distribution. The evidence root may be a real
directory outside the repository, or the repository's absolute root only when
the bound `memory/runs/<run-id>` directory is Git-ignored and wholly untracked.
Never upload the receipt, report, or raw evidence. The real-provider smoke run
executes real models, but its cases are simulated semantic fixtures. It proves
engineering conformance, not customer or real-project outcomes; the public
release status must say so.

Real-project profile evidence is a **post-release promotion gate**. The legacy
`release-pilot` stage and `profile-pilots-v19` receipt name remain supported for
compatibility, but neither authorizes a release. Collect the full cohort against
the exact released source: 14 pilots (at least two per discipline), 70
randomized paired Lite/Governed projects (10 per discipline), and 28 shadow
projects (four per discipline), with two distinct blind reviewers. Keep all
evidence outside Git and run
`python3 scripts/verify-profile-outcomes.py /private/path/evidence.json
--stage governed-promotion --source-commit "$RELEASE_COMMIT"
--release-candidate 20.0.0-rc.N
--evidence-manifest /private/path/manifest.json --receipt
/private/path/promotion-receipt.json --json`. The verifier refuses simulated,
duplicated, or identity-mismatched evidence and checks the attested private
manifest digest. Until the full 14 + 70 + 28 cohort passes, Lite remains the
fresh-project default; Governed capability availability must not be described
as validated Governed outcomes or as validation for Governed-by-default.
Never synthesize private evidence or a receipt.

After the engineering-validation gate passes, (a)
run `python3 scripts/create-github-release.py` as a network-free preview and its
`--live --receipt <private-receipt> --maturity-report <private-report>
--evidence-root <absolute-private-root> --asset-dir <verified-assets>` form to
create or read-only verify the immutable tag/release; (b) sync the downstream
GitHub About surface with `sync-about.sh`; (c) sync the downstream repo family
with `sync-family.sh`; and (d) publish the Governed-ceiling/Lite-default bundle and
per-skill registry records. Full gate, rollback, and distribution order:
[docs/distribution.md](docs/distribution.md). All external mutations are
owner-run. Between releases, the weekly `family-drift.yml` and
`about-drift.yml` sentinels fail red if either surface drifts.

**CI enforces this list**: the release-surface generator detects projection
drift, and `scripts/check-versions.sh` validates product-version bindings and
each skill row. A coordinated cut additionally runs
`bash scripts/check-versions.sh --release-all-current`, which requires exactly
120/120 skills on the same bundle version/date. Run both locally before pushing.

**Adding a connector?** Follow [docs/connector-playbook.md](docs/connector-playbook.md) — the end-to-end pipeline (qualify → verify → implement → test → wire → document → track → regress → record) with the safety-class gate table and the connector-vs-recipe decision rule.

## Improving Existing Skills

Keep changes focused. Bump both top-level `version` and `metadata.version` together. Update `VERSIONS.md`. Put new reference docs in the skill's `references/` subdirectory.

## Craft Checklist

Beyond the mechanical checks, every skill should pass the senior self-test from [skill-contract.md §Skill Authoring Discipline](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/aaron-marketing-skills/blob/main/references/skill-contract.md):

- [ ] **Simplicity** — would a senior engineer call this skill overcomplicated? Every section traces to the user's task.
- [ ] **Boundary** — the `description` ends with a `Not for X — use Y` clause so it doesn't compete with a sibling skill.
- [ ] **Verifiable** — the Skill Contract states a `Done when:` with checkable conditions.
- [ ] **Honest data** — Instructions tell the model to label Measured / User-provided / Estimated and never invent numbers.
- [ ] **Surgical handoff** — Next Best Skill points to exactly one primary move.

## Quality Checklist (mechanical)

Before submitting a PR:

- [ ] `name` matches directory name (lowercase slug `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$`)

- [ ] `description` includes trigger phrases AND scope boundaries (≤1024 chars)
- [ ] Shared compact section contract present (`validate-skill.sh` checks this)
- [ ] Validator passes: `./scripts/validate-skill.sh <category>/<skill-name>`
- [ ] Uses `~~placeholder` pattern for tool references
- [ ] `allowed-tools: WebFetch` added if skill fetches live URLs
